Hey! I'm a 20 y.o. computer science student from Germany, currently trying to code as often as possible to get used to failing and still trying:). I'm especially interested in (Android) app development, data science and bioinformatics. At the moment I focus on learning Android App Development with Java. Feel free to ask me about anything:)
