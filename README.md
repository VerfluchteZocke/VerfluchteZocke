Hey! I'm a female 20 y.o. computer science student from Germany, currently trying to code as often as possible to get used to failing and still trying:). At the moment I learn Java (Greedy algorithm, dynamic programming, ...). I'm not sure in which field I am going to work one day, but what I know is that I'm especially interested in (Android) app development and bioinformatics. Feel free to ask me about anything:)
